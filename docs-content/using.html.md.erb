This topic describes how to use Sentry Service Broker for PCF.

##<a id='using'></a> Using Sentry Service Broker for PCF

To use the Sentry Service Broker for PCF with an application, create a service instance and bind the service instance
to your application. For more information on managing service instances, see <a href="http://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/devguide/services/managing-services.html" target="_blank">Managing Service Instances with the cf CLI</a>.

After the Sentry tile is installed, you can see the `sentry-service-broker` and its service plans appear in your PCF marketplace. Run `cf marketplace` to see the service listing:
<pre class="terminal">
$ cf marketplace
Getting services from marketplace in org sentry / space sentry as admin...
OK
service                plans   description
sentry-service-broker  free    Free hobbyist plan
</pre>

### Create a Service Instance

To provision a Sentry service instance, run `cf create-service`. For example:

<pre class="terminal">
$ cf create-service sentry-service-broker free my-sentry-service
Getting services from marketplace in org sentry / space sentry as admin...
OK
name                service                 plan   bound apps   last operation
my-sentry-service   sentry-service-broker   free                create succeeded
</pre>

Run the `cf services` command to view the creation status. This command displays a list of all your service instances. To view the status of a specific service instance, run `cf service NAME-OF-YOUR-SERVICE`.
### Bind an Application to a Service Instance

After your Sentry service instance is created, run `cf bind-service` to bind the service to your application:

<pre class="terminal">
$ cf bind-service my-app my-sentry-service
</pre>
### Restage or Restart Your Application

To enable your application to access the service instance, run `cf restage` or `cf restart` to restage or restart your application.
### Obtain Service Instance Access Credentials

After a service instance is bound to an application, Sentry credentials are stored in the environment variables of the application. Run `cf env APP-NAME` to display the environment variables.

You can find the credentials in the <a href="http://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/devguide/deploy-apps/environment-variable.html#VCAP-SERVICES" target="_blank">VCAP_SERVICES</a> key.

<pre class="terminal">
$ cf env my-app
Getting env variables for app my-app in org sentry / space sentry as admin...
OK

System-Provided:
{
 "VCAP_SERVICES": {
  "sentry-service-broker": [
   {
     "credentials": {
      "uri": "YOUR_SENTRY_DSN",
     },
   }
  ]
 }
}
...
</pre>

Finally, you can use the provided Sentry DSN to configure the applicable Sentry SDK. See the [Sentry documentation site](https://docs.sentry.io/) for more information.
